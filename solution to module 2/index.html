                <h2> Varkala Beach </h2>
                <p>
        Varkala beach lies about an hour north of capital Trivandrum in Kerala and provides a relatively peaceful alternative to the now commercialized Kovalam. The setting of this beach is striking enough to take your breath away, with a seemingly endless paved stretch of cliff bordered by shacks on one side and views that extend over the Arabian Sea on the other. It's the perfect place to rest and rejuvenate, with yoga and Ayurveda being popular there.  </p>

                <h2>  Radhanagar Beach </h2>
                <p>
 Radhanagar Beach is situated on Havelock Island in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which are sprinkled across the Bay of Bengal. The islands are a Union Territory of India. Radhanagar Beach (also referred to as beach number seven) is renowned for its calm, still water and fine white sand.</p>

                <h2> Palolem Beach </h2>
                <p>
         Palolem Beach, enclosed by a thick forest of coconut palms in far South Goa, is arguably the state's most picturesque beach. This mile-long, semi-circle shaped beach continues to grow in popularity every year. It's the most lively beach in the area but still retains its relaxed vibe, as permanent structures aren't allowed to be built on it.  </p>
